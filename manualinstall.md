# Manually Installing Modules

Taken from [here](https://github.com/DocilElm/Doc-Ct-Guide/blob/main/misc/ManualInstall.md)

### Getting the module zip
First we need MeowAddons.zip, for this we'll head over to the [Chattriggers MeowAddons Link](https://www.chattriggers.com/modules/v/meowaddons) and click the `Download` button<br>
<br>
### Dependencies

Download the [Dependencies.zip](https://github.com/kiwidotzip/MeowAddons/releases/tag/Dependencies) file and extract it. It should contain several other folders (modules)

### Wrapping things up
Once we have all of our folders (aka "modules") we can now go in game and type `/ct files` and hit enter<br>
A file window will pop up, we open the folder that is called `modules` and paste all of the folders that we have gathered thus far<br>
After that we can head back over in game and type `/ct load` and hit enter.<br>
And that should be it, you _should_ have properly manually installed the desired module.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure that the folders do not have a folder inside otherwise the module will not work properly.<br>
> for example: If i unzipped Vigilance-1.3.2 and it has a folder inside called Vigilance this folder inside is the module itself that i need
